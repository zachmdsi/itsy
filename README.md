# itsy

**itsy** is a lightweight, flexible, and hypermedia-driven web framework. Its aim is to enable the creation of API endpoints that make full use of hypermedia controls, improving discoverability and allowing for more robust client-server interactions. Itsy achieves this by providing interfaces and abstractions that guide the structure and functionality of your application resources.
